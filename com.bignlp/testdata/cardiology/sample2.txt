DATE OF CONSULTATION:  MM/DD/YYYY

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  John Doe, MD 

CONSULTING PHYSICIAN:  Jane Doe, MD 

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This (XX)-year-old lady is seen in consultation for Dr. John Doe. She has been under consideration for ventral hernia repair and has a background of aortic valve replacement and known coronary artery disease.  The patient was admitted with complaints of abdominal pain, anorexia, and vomiting. She underwent a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis and this showed the ventral hernia involving the transverse colon, but without strangulation. There was an atrophic right kidney. She had bilateral renal cysts. The hepatic flexure wall was thickened. There was sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis. It has been recommended to her that she undergo repair of the ventral hernia. For this reason, cardiology consult is obtained to assess whether she can be cared from the cardiac standpoint.

PAST CARDIAC HISTORY:  Bypass surgery. She underwent echocardiography and cardiac catheterization prior to the operation. Echocardiography showed an ejection fraction of 50%. There was marked left ventricular hypertrophy with septal wall 1.60 cm and posterior wall 1.55 cm. Coronary arteriography showed 90% stenosis in the anterior descending artery, situated distally just before the apex of the left ventricle. Only mild to moderate narrowing was seen elsewhere in the coronary circulation.

CORONARY RISK FACTORS:  Her father had an irregular heartbeat and her brother had a fatal heart attack. She herself has had high blood pressure for 20 years. She has elevated cholesterol and takes Lipitor. She has had diabetes for 20 years. She is not a cigarette smoker. She does little physical exercise.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  CARDIOVASCULAR AND RESPIRATORY:  She has no chest pain. She sometimes becomes short of breath if she walks too far. No cough. She has occasional swelling of her feet. Occasionally, she gets mildly lightheaded. Has not lost consciousness. She tends to be aware of her heartbeat when she is tired. She has no history of heart murmur or rheumatic fever. GASTROINTESTINAL:  Recent GI symptoms as noted above, but she does not usually have such problems. She has had no hematemesis. She has no history of ulcer or jaundice. She sometimes has loose stools. No constipation and no blood in the stool. GENITOURINARY:  She tends to have urinary frequency. She gets up once at night to pass urine. No dysuria, incontinence. She has had previous urinary infections. No stones noted. NEUROLOGIC:  She has occasional headaches. No seizures. No trouble with vision, hearing, or speech. No limb weakness. MUSCULOSKELETAL:  She tends to have joint and muscle pains and has a history of gout. HEMATOLOGIC:  No anemia, abnormal bleeding, or previous blood transfusion. GYNECOLOGIC:  No gynecologic or breast problems.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  She has had shoulder and hand injuries and has had carpal tunnel surgery. She has been diabetic and has been on insulin. She has chronic renal insufficiency with creatinine around 2.2. She has had hypothyroidism. She has had morbid obesity. She has chronic obstructive sleep apnea and uses BiPAP. She has had hysterectomy and oophorectomy in the past. Otherwise as noted above.

MEDICATIONS:  Prior to hospital, she was taking glipizide XL 2.5 mg daily, metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d., Cipro 250 mg b.i.d., atorvastatin 40 mg daily, Synthroid 75 mcg daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, and Lantus 36 units daily. Currently, she is taking Lipitor 40 mg daily, Lantus 10 units at bedtime, Synthroid 75 mcg daily, metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d., and Zosyn 2.25 grams q.6h.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not drink alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL APPEARANCE:  She is not currently dyspneic, in no distress. She is alert, oriented, and pleasant.
HEENT:  Pupils are normal and react normally. No icterus. Mucous membranes well colored.
NECK:  Supple. No lymphadenopathy. Jugular venous pressure not elevated. Carotids equal. 
HEART:  The heart rate is 82 per minute and regular and the blood pressure 132/78. The cardiac impulse has a normal quality. There is a grade 3/6 ejection systolic murmur heard medial to the apex and at the aortic area, with well heard radiation to the neck vessels.
CHEST:  Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation. Normal respiratory effort.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender. The presence of a large ventral hernia is noted.
EXTREMITIES:  There is no edema. Posterior tibial pulses were felt bilaterally, but I did not feel the dorsalis pedis.
SKIN:  No rash or significant lesions are noted.

LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC DATA:  Electrolytes are normal. BUN and creatinine 18/2.2. Blood sugar 150. White count is 7.6, hemoglobin 11.7 with hematocrit 34.9, platelets 187,000. LFTs were normal. Hemoglobin A1c 7.7. TSH 1.82. Troponin I was normal on three occasions.

Chest x-ray showed an enlarged heart with postoperative changes, but no evidence of acute pathology. EKG shows probable left atrial enlargement. Low voltage QRS, probable inferior wall myocardial infarction and anterior wall infarction, age undetermined.

ASSESSMENT:
1.  Aortic valve replacement with bioprosthetic valve. Residual systolic murmur.
2.  Arteriosclerotic heart disease with severe stenosis in anterior descending artery, but this is situated distally and subtends only a small mass of myocardium.
3.  Well preserved left ventricular systolic function. The EKG appearance of previous myocardial infarction is probably serious, indicating multiple other medical problems as listed above and also documented in the chart.

RECOMMENDATIONS:  It appears that she does not wish to proceed with the surgery at this time, and if such surgery is not urgently required, then I would simply recommend that she resume her previous preadmission medical program. If, however, the surgery is felt to be urgently needed and she changes her mind and wishes to proceed, then I think this can be done without excessive cardiovascular risk. Given the recent evaluations, I do not think additional cardiac testing would be needed at this time. She should of course receive the usual precautions for cardiac patients undergoing surgery, including careful watch of EKG perioperatively, with observation of heart rate, blood pressure, and fluid and electrolyte balance. Additionally, she would require appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis to protect the bioprosthetic valve against endocarditis.

Thank you very much for asking me to see this patient. I will be pleased to follow her further in the hospital upon request.
