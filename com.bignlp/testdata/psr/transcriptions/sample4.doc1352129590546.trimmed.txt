PLAN:
We will obtain anemia profile as well as stool guaiac test.
The patient was advised regarding an upper endoscopy to rule out peptic ulcer disease.
If upper endoscopy is unremarkable, then we will proceed with a colonoscopy for further evaluation.  The procedure, risks, and benefits were discussed with the patient and the patient is agreeable for the procedure.
Thank you Dr. Shelton for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient.
