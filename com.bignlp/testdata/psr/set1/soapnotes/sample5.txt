SUBJECTIVE:  The patient reports some abdominal discomfort.  He notes that he has not had a bowel movement in about a week and has been inconsistent taking his bowel medications.

OBJECTIVE:  Temperature 97.2 degrees, pulse 88, respirations 20, and blood pressure 124/82.  The head and neck examination was unremarkable.  Heart and lung examinations were within normal limits.  However, there was an intact chest wound site along the right axillary line and two chest tube sites were noted in the anterior axillary line, on the right.  The patient wore a Sarmiento brace with a cap.  He is also wearing a Jewett brace.  The abdomen was slightly protuberant and hyperresonant to percussion.  No masses were noted, though the abdomen was somewhat firm.  There was no rebound tenderness.  Although, the patient had an apparent right hand swelling.  Mid palm circumference was 21.2 cm bilaterally.  There was no MCP tenderness in either hand.  A 3D brace was noted on the right.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Rehabilitation:  The patient continues to require encouragement to perform rehabilitation tasks.  Once focused on a task, the patient appears to be doing fairly well.  Continue comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation.
2.  Spine stability:  Stable with the Jewett brace.
3.  Right humerus fracture:  The patient now has a new Sarmiento brace with shoulder cap.  This is fitting well.
4.  Right hand swelling:  Noted at first glance, although, examination was unremarkable.  There is no evidence of complex regional pain syndrome, type I.  We will continue to follow.  We will make sure that the Sarmiento brace is not too tight.
5.  Neuropathic pain:  The patient states that he is under great control of the pain with Neurontin and Elavil.  However, he also reports feeling a bit drowsy.  He also notes that he has been inconsistent taking the Neurontin.  We will therefore decrease the Neurontin to 600 mg t.i.d.  The patient was told the importance of taking medications on a regular basis to maintain blood serum levels of the drug.  He appreciated this discussion.
7.  Pain:  Good control.  Again, he mentioned some drowsiness.  We will consider decreasing the methadone to 5 mg b.i.d. if drowsiness continues.  The pain is not interfering with therapies.
