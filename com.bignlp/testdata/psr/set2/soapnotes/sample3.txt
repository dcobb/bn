SUBJECTIVE:  The patient is a (XX)-year-old man who I first saw on MM/DD/YYYY when he was looking for a second opinion regarding his left internal carotid artery occlusion versus near total occlusion. His complaints included, about (XX) years ago, developing diplopia which occurs when looking to the left or the right, which has not changed since then. He was found to have a possible left internal carotid artery blockage and was seen by Dr. Doe about six years ago, who started him on Plavix. He was also being followed for what is reported as a distended left cavernous sinus. Since I last saw him, he has not had any new neurologic symptoms. He did have an MRI and MRA performed. I reviewed these films with him showing him the small hyperintensities, particularly in the left centrum semiovale region. This was unchanged compared to his previous MRI. He did have gadolinium injected, and with the gadolinium injection, the aortic arch was viewed as well as all of his cervical and intracranial vessels. He did have a normal appearing left common carotid artery, but the left internal carotid was occluded at the origin. His right carotid artery and bilateral vertebral arteries appeared normal in caliber. He has normal flow through the middle cerebral artery and anterior cerebral artery bilaterally. He does have some mild to moderate atrophy on MRI of his brain and there are no changes in terms of his left cavernous sinus. In particular, there is no lesion to explain any cranial nerve dysfunction that was causing him to have diplopia. He is on Plavix 75 mg daily. He takes some nasal spray and he occasionally takes antianxiety medications as well as multivitamin once a day. 

OBJECTIVE:  On examination, his weight is 201.7 pounds which is unchanged compared to his last visit. His temperature is 98.5. His blood pressure is 126/80. His heart rate is 72. His respirations 22. His neck is supple without bruits. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart is regular rate without murmurs. Abdomen is soft with normoactive bowel sounds, nontender. He has no edema on extremity examination. On neurologic examination, he is alert and fully oriented with normal speech and language. His pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light at 4 mm and extraocular movements were nearly full, but with bilateral lateral gaze. He does have nystagmus. When he looks fully to the left and fully over to the right, he complains of vertical diplopia which is worse on the right gaze. When he looks straight ahead, he does not note any diplopia. He has no ptosis. Motor examination is 5/5 strength throughout and had no pronator drift; although, I had noted a slight right pronator drift on his last visit. Sensation was normal to light touch.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  My impression is that the patient is a (XX)-year-old man who has a completely occluded left internal carotid artery at the origin. With that, he has developed collateral flow and he does have some tiny hyperintensities, particularly in the left hemisphere, that may have been related to narrowing carotid artery in the past. He did have some question of slight trickle of flow on a conventional angiogram performed in the past, but there is clearly no flow on this MR angiogram with gadolinium. Given that the vessel appears completely occluded, I told him that the best treatment is for him to keep well hydrated and to help with his collateral flow as well as to continue on his antiplatelet agent, which is Plavix. I explained that interventional maneuvers such as stenting or carotid endarterectomy were not possible with an occluded vessel. We also discussed treating his cholesterol for which he is on Pravachol and he will try to obtain the results of this most recent fasting lipid profile, so that I can determine that he is on an appropriate dose of Pravachol. He will obtain the names of his medications and dosages and call my office with those. We also discussed his difficulties with insomnia and I recommended again that he see his urologist, as he does have some nocturia. With regard to the questionable left cavernous sinus findings on MRI in the past, there have been no changes with this MRI, so I will not recommend any further imaging studies as I am not seeing any abnormalities there. As far as his diplopia, he states that prisms did not work for him. I told him that he could follow up with me as needed in future and emphasized the need to treat his risk factors for stroke including his hypercholesterolemia.
