REQUESTING PHYSICIAN:  John Doe, MD

REASON FOR CONSULTATION:  Evaluation and diabetes management.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a (XX)-year-old woman with a history of diabetes since (XXXX), when she presented with an acute illness and was hospitalized and started on insulin. She has remained on insulin ever since and currently is on Lantus 40 units at night and NovoLog 7 units before meals. Her diabetes has been complicated by ESRD, on dialysis for (X) years, followed by Dr. Doe. The patient has proliferative retinopathy, followed by Dr. Jane Doe, and has peripheral neuropathy with prior amputation of her left big toe and follows with Podiatry, with orthopedic shoes having been recently ordered for her. The patient was admitted on MM/DD/YYYY because of cellulitis involving her right leg. She was hospitalized previously in October, apparently for a similar condition and also had a blood clot at that time. She checks her blood sugars three to four times a day at home and has occasional hypoglycemic episode. Consultation was requested because of erratic blood sugars over the last couple of days.
